# Integrating Channel opt ins

{% hint style="info" %}
Users don't have to come to our dApp to opt in to your channel. In fact, it's recommended to have opt in from within your frontend to improve their experience.&#x20;

For a detailed view of how to integrate various part of EPNS SDK, please goto this section :point\_right: [epns-sdk](../../developer-tooling/epns-sdk/ "mention")
