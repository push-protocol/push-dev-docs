# Notification via Subgraph example

Alright, now that we have an effective understanding of sending notifications via subgraph and the setup procedure involved for the same, it's time to dive in deep and understand this wonderful feature with an example.

### The objective of this exercise

This is a walkthrough of how one can set up **Subgraph based EPNS Notifications**. Even if you are not much familiar with EPNS or The Graph, you could straight away start from here and follow the respective links to dive in.&#x20;

In this example, we integrate EPNS with an ERC-20 contract subgraph and link it to an EPNS Notification Channel **to send out notifications whenever a Transfer happens**.

### Pre-requisites

1. Have an EPNS Notification Channel ready - see the docs [here](https://docs.epns.io/developers/developer-zone/create-your-notif-channel) to create a channel
2. Install the **graph CLI**

```jsx
npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli

yarn global add @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```

3\. Link your Github to the graph website -[https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/)

4\. Add a subgraph named XXXX from your Hosted Service Dashboard -[https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/dashboard](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/dashboard)

### **Contract deployment**

1. Copy the ERC-20 contract -[https://github.com/aiswaryawalter/epns-graph-token-alerter/blob/main/contracts/PushToken.sol](https://github.com/aiswaryawalter/epns-graph-token-alerter/blob/main/contracts/PushToken.sol)
2. Deploy on the Kovan Test Network using the Remix IDE - [https://remix.ethereum.org/](https://remix.ethereum.org/\*\*)

### **Subgraph deployment**

#### Create a subgraph

1. Clone the ERC-20 token subgraph -[https://github.com/aiswaryawalter/erc-20-token-subgraph.git](https://github.com/aiswaryawalter/erc-20-token-subgraph.git)
2. In `subgraph.yaml` update the contract address to the one you just deployed
3.  Install packages

    ```jsx
    yarn install
    ```
4.  Generate code

    ```jsx
    graph codegen
    ```
5.  Get the access token from the Graph dashboard & authenticate

    ```jsx
    graph auth --product hosted-service <ACCESS_TOKEN>
    ```
6.  Deploy the subgraph

    ```jsx
    graph deploy --product hosted-service <GITHUB_USER>/<SUBGRAPH NAME>
    ```
7. See the subgraph playground

#### Integrate EPNS to the subgraph

1.  In `schema.graphql`, include the following EPNS Schema

    ```jsx
    type EpnsNotificationCounter @entity {
      id: ID!
      totalCount: BigInt!
    }

    type EpnsPushNotification @entity {
      id: ID!
      notificationNumber: BigInt!
      recipient: String!
      notification: String!
    }
    ```
2.  In `mapping.ts`, export the subgraph ID

    ```jsx
    //Note: EPNS supports only The Graph Hosted Service at present

    export const subgraphID = "aiswaryawalter/push-token"
    ```
3. In `src/` create a file - `EPNSNotification.ts`. Copy & paste the Helper File code from[https://github.com/aiswaryawalter/epns-graph-token-alerter/blob/main/src/EPNSNotification.ts](https://github.com/aiswaryawalter/epns-graph-token-alerter/blob/main/src/EPNSNotification.ts)&#x20;
4.  In `mapping.ts` import the helper file

    ```jsx
    import { sendEPNSNotification } from "./EPNSNotification"
    ```

Follow steps 5, 6 and 7 within the respective handler functions from which the notification needs to be sent👇🏼

5\. Define Notification Payload Items

```jsx
let recipient = event.params.to.toHexString(),
  type = "3",
  title = "PUSH Received",
  body = `Received ${event.params.tokens.div(power)} PUSH from ${event.params.from.toHexString()}`,
  subject = "PUSH Received",
  message = `Received ${event.params.tokens.div(power)} PUSH from ${event.params.from.toHexString()}`,
  image = "https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/i911_wMmFilaAAOTLvlQJZMXoxBF34BMSzRmascHezvurtslYUgOHamxgEnMXTklsF-S",
  secret = "null",
  cta = "https://epns.io/"
```

6\. Define Notification

The `notification` variable is defined in the given below format 👇🏼

**Format : `{"field" : "value"}`**

```jsx
let notification = `{\"type\": \"${type}\", \"title\": \"${title}\", \"body\": \"${body}\", \"subject\": \"${subject}\", \"message\": \"${message}\", \"image\": \"${image}\", \"secret\": \"${secret}\", \"cta\": \"${cta}\"}`
```

7\. Call the EPNS Helper Function

```jsx
sendEPNSNotification (recipient, notification)
```

#### Redeploy Subgraph

1.  Generate code

    ```jsx
    graph codegen
    ```
2.  Get the access token from the Graph dashboard & authenticate

    ```jsx
    graph auth --product hosted-service <ACCESS_TOKEN>
    ```
3.  Deploy the subgraph

    ```jsx
    graph deploy --product hosted-service <GITHUB_USER>/<SUBGRAPH NAME>
    ```
4.  In the subgraph playground, paste the below **query** & show the notification payloads

    ```jsx
    {
    epnsPushNotifications(first: 20) {
    id
    notificationNumber
    recipient
    notification
    }
    }
    ```



Here is the final subgraph with EPNS integration - [https://github.com/aiswaryawalter/epns-graph-token-alerter](https://github.com/aiswaryawalter/epns-graph-token-alerter)

### **Linking Subgraph to EPNS Notification Channel**

* Go to EPNS dApp ([https://staging.epns.io/](https://staging.epns.io/)) → Channel Dashboard → Settings → Add Subgraph Details
*   Enter your `Subgraph ID`_(githubID/subgraph-slug)_ and `Poll Interval` _(in seconds, must be at least 60 sec or more)_

    **Poll Interval** (in seconds) defines the time period at which Push Nodes shall ping the subgraph for fetching the latest notifications.

    **Note:** This is an on-chain transaction that stores the above data to **EPNS Core Contract.** So it requires $ETH for gas fees.

### **Testing Notification**

1. &#x20;`Opt-in` to the newly created channel
2. Initiate a `Transfer` transaction&#x20;
3. Wait for the notification to appear on the recipient's wallet via EPNS dApp, Mobile App, Browser Extension
