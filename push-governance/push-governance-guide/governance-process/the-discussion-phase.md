# The Discussion Phase

The next step in the governance journey is discussion. Draft proposals from the Proposal phase that meet the promotion criteria are promoted to the [Governance Discussions Forum](https://gov.epns.io/c/governance-discussions/5) by a PUSH Champion.

Draft proposals in this phase should initiate discussion. We expect and encourage the community to debate them and express approval or disapproval.

### Submitting a Draft Proposal for Discussion

* Only Champions can push draft proposals once they have met the criteria to Governance Discussion.
* This section is intended to serve as the last step before submitting a proposal to [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/epns.eth).
* Proposals can be pushed through to this section once enough traction has been gained in the Governance Proposals section.
* From here, draft proposals become a formal proposal once promotion criteria is met and will subsequently be pushed to Snapshot[ ](https://epns.io/)for voting to commence.
* Only PUSH Delegatees (users who have 75k+ votes) (delegated or owned) can initiate the formal proposal. If the user doesn’t have enough votes, then it’s expected of the user to either find a Delegatee to submit their formal proposal or request a Champion to find one for them.

### What are the Promotion Criteria?

A draft proposal becomes a formal proposal if the following criteria are met:

* Must be live for 5+ days in the Governance Discussion category
* Proposal on Forum must receive at least 10 likes
* Proposal on Forum must have a minimum of 3 replies

Note: _The draft proposal promoted by PUSH Champions can deviate a bit from what started in the Governance Proposal section owing to the discussion and the spirit of the proposal. In the event of discrepancies between the draft proposal submitted in the Governance Proposal section and the Governance Discussion section, the proposal under the Governance Discussion section will prevail._
