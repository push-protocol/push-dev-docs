# Design Notification Content

EPNS enables you to send rich-media-enabled notifications and add suitable details to make them as engaging and useful as possible. Here is a quick dive into all the interesting stuff that you can send in a notification.

### How to design content rich notifications?

Step 1: Learn various ways by which content can be defined.

{% content-ref url="../../developer-guides/sending-notifications/notification-payload-types/notification-standard-advanced/notification-content.md" %}
[notification-content.md](../../developer-guides/sending-notifications/notification-payload-types/notification-standard-advanced/notification-content.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Step 2: Test is out on Staging dApp > Send Notification which creates a real time preview of how notification will look

{% embed url="https://staging.epns.io/#/dashboard" %}
Staging dApp
{% endembed %}

{% embed url="https://app.epns.io/#/dashboard" %}
